/***
 * Given a 2d grid map of '1's (land) and '0's (water), count the number of islands. An island is surrounded by water and is
 * formed by connecting adjacent lands horizontally or vertically. You may assume all four edges of the grid are all surrounded by water.
 *
 * Input: grid = [
 *   ["1","1","1","1","0"],
 *   ["1","1","0","1","0"],
 *   ["1","1","0","0","0"],

 * Output: 1
